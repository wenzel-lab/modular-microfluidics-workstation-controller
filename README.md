# "Rio" the modular microfluidics controller [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

This repository contains the _free_ and _open-source_ designs and documentation for the _core board_ and their _modules_ of a microfluidics workstation to enable _high-throughput droplet microfluidic_ biological assays. The designs contain an electronics board "hat" that plugs onto a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and interfaces with our _compact controllers_ e.g. for gas-pressure control to push microfluidic samples onto chips, pressure, and flow measurement with feedback control, sample holders with heating and stirring, and imaging of fast droplet generation processes with open-source microscopy and stroboscopic illumination.

This is an open, collaborative project by the [Wenzel Lab](https://wenzel-lab.github.io/en/) in Chile, and _your participation_ (comments, inputs, contributions) are explicitly welcome! Please submit your message as an issue in this repository to participate.

## Why "Rio" ##

Our aim is to create a prototype of a _compact_ working station for microfluidic research that is based on _connectable_, _open_, modern, and _low-cost_ components (Rasberry Pi, Arduino, 3D printing, on-board components, open or at least accessible design software and operation software - python).

**Rio** serves as a platform to implement fully functional research-grade workstations with good specifications, such as fast reaction times and low-pressure fluctuations. It is modular so that parts of this platform can be repurposed and improved in the open-source hardware sense and easily combined, exchanged, or used independently in challenging environments.

## Getting Started ##

In order to implement a workstation, you must build the core board and any module of your interest. The user interface software will allow you to control and monitor the operations of the modules.

### Core Board

The core board consists of a Raspberry Pi 4B+ and a custom Pi HAT (hardware attached to the top). The Pi HAT is an extension board for bidirectional communication and power supply to the controllers.

</tr>

### Modules

A _module_ commonly consists of a compact controller, sensors, and actuators, and operates with distinct power supply and data connections. The controllers convert physical data into digital data, manipulate the actuators, and supply energy to external components.

</tr>

### Software

The software follows a client-server architecture and allows users to control the physical hardware through a graphical interface. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 32-bit operating system.
